The .NET look-alike threading library for C++

I put this here under the open MIT license to help make this small library shareable accross projects.

The goal of this library is to allow a C++ developer using C++14 or later to save a little time with
threading implementation.  

This uses all C++, no add-in library is needed.   

This is just a few headers and nothing else.  So you can just add it to your includes and be done with it.

It't not fancy in any way and suggestions for improvement are always welcomed.
